# Health Queue

## About

Project prepared as a partial requirement for completion of the Data Structures subject of the Degree in Computing at IFBA - Campus Jacobina.

The program, developed in the C programming language, registers hospitals and patients from these hospitals in dynamic data structures.

It uses a simply linked list to store hospitals, with each one having a queue to store patients.

We work with manipulation of random access memory addresses (through pointers) and dynamic memory allocation, low-level resources that C provides.

Health Queue is compatible with the Windows operating system and the mingw64 compiler, we may also make it portable for Linux systems in the future, in addition to implementing data persistence in binary files.
